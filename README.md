for Static Server
For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 3000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -l or --listen flags:
```
serve -s build -l 4000
```
Run this command to get a full list of the options available:
```
serve -h
```


> Note: For the Windows operating system, separate the paths by semicolons in the `.env` file.
